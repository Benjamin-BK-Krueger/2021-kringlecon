## About KringleCon
KringleCon relates to SANS' Holiday Hacking Challenge which happens yearly around the Christmas time. You can find more information about the event here: https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge/



It does not matter if you are a InfoSec newbie, a Pro or somewhere in-between like me, there are challenges for everyone and a lot of information and fun. Have a look and enter KringleCon, if you’re stuck somewhere feel free to use my “guide”. If you have questions or a better solution reach out to me.
