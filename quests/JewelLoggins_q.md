Welcome, Kringlecon attendee! The candy striper is running as a service on                   
this terminal, but I can't remember the password. Like a sticky note under the               
keyboard, I put the password on another machine in this network. Problem is: I               
don't have the IP address of that other host.
Please do what you can to help me out. Find the other machine, retrieve the                
password, and enter it into the Candy Striper in the pane above. I know you                
can get it running again!
```
